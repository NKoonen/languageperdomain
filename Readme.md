# Language per Domain

**Compatible with PrestaShop 1.7, 8 & 9**

(for Prestashop 1.7 and 8 check the ps-17 branch on GitHub)

---

## 🧩 What does this module do?

This module allows you to assign a specific domain (or subdomain) to each language in your PrestaShop store — **without using PrestaShop’s Multistore feature**.

For example:

- `example.com` → English
- `example.fr` → French
- `example.de` → German

When a visitor enters one of those domains directly, the website will **automatically switch to the correct language** based on your configuration.

---

## 🌍 Who is this for?

This is ideal for merchants who:

- Want separate domains for SEO or branding per language.
- Don’t need or want the complexity of PrestaShop Multistore.
- Prefer simple language-to-domain mapping.

---

## ✅ Features

- Assign a unique domain (or subdomain) to each language.
- Automatically detects and switches language based on the domain.
- Backend configuration panel to manage domains per language.
- Automatically updates PrestaShop to recognize the new domains.
- No need to activate Multistore or duplicate products.

---

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

You run a store with three (or more) languages:
- English
- French
- Spanish

You want:
- `www.mystore.com` for English
- `www.maboutique.fr` for French
- `www.mitienda.es` for Spanish

Simply configure those domains in the module settings, and each domain will display the correct language **without extra setup**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- You must point all domains to the same PrestaShop installation (same hosting).
- You are responsible for configuring your domain DNS and SSL certificates.
- This module does not translate content — it only switches the active language.

---

## 🔒 GDPR & Compatibility

- Fully compatible with PrestaShop’s core behavior.
- No customer data is processed or stored.
